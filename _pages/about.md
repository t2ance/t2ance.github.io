# About me
I'm currently a senior undergraduate at the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), majoring in Computer Science and Technology.
At SUSTech, I'm supervised by Professor [Xin Yao](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~xin/), and then by Professor [Jianguo Zhang](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/zhangjianguo.html).
I'm also pleased to have worked with Professor [Liyan Song](https://sunnysong14.github.io/) and [Siang Yew Chong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cI4Rf8cAAAAJ&hl=en).
I was also once a visiting student at University of California, San Diego (UCSD).
During my study at UCSD, I did internship with Professor [Pengtao Xie](https://pengtaoxie.github.io/) and Professor [Yuanyuan Shi](https://yyshi.eng.ucsd.edu/), separately.

My research interests center on machine learning and its application in a wide range of fields, including computer vision, natural language processing, data mining, and dynamic systems.
**I am looking for a PhD position beginning from 2025 fall in related field of my research interests.**
Please refer to my [curriculum vitae](https://t2ance.github.io/files/Curriculum-Vitae.pdf) and [statement of purpose]() on details about my research interests.

# More
- I'm a big fan of Math and have tried study every aspect that are interesting to me (And how them can be used to improve machine learning methods).
See the [courses](https://t2ance.github.io/files/Transcript-UCSD.pdf) I've taken when I was a visiting student at UCSD.
