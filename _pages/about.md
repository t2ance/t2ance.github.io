# About Me
I am currently a senior undergraduate at the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), majoring in Computer Science and Technology.
At SUSTech, I have been fortunate to be supervised by Professor [Xin Yao](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~xin/) and later by Professor [Jianguo Zhang](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/zhangjianguo.html).
I have also had the pleasure of collaborating with Professor [Liyan Song](https://sunnysong14.github.io/) and [Siang Yew Chong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cI4Rf8cAAAAJ&hl=en).
Additionally, I was a visiting student at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), where I interned under Professor [Pengtao Xie](https://pengtaoxie.github.io/) and Professor [Yuanyuan Shi](https://yyshi.eng.ucsd.edu/) in separate projects.

My research interests lie in the field of machine learning and its applications in various domains, such as computer vision, natural language processing, data mining, and dynamic systems.
**I am actively seeking a PhD position starting in Fall 2025 in a field related to my research interests.**
For more details, please refer to my [curriculum vitae](https://t2ance.github.io/files/Curriculum-Vitae.pdf) and [statement of purpose](https://t2ance.github.io/files/Statement-of-Purpose.pdf).

# More About Me
- I am passionate about mathematics and have explored various aspects that interest me (And how they can be applied to improve machine learning techniques).
See the [courses](https://t2ance.github.io/files/Transcript-UCSD.pdf) I took as a visiting student at UCSD.

- I participated in the iGEM 2023 competition as part of the SUSTech-CHINA team, where I was responsible for wiki development.
Our team won a silver medal.
See our wiki [here](https://2023.igem.wiki/sustech-china/) and my certificate [here](https://t2ance.github.io/files/igem-2023-certificates.pdf).
