# About Me

I am currently a final year undergraduate at the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), majoring in
Computer Science and Technology.
At SUSTech, I have been fortunate to be supervised by Professor [Xin Yao](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~xin/) and later by
Professor [Jianguo Zhang](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/zhangjianguo.html).
I have also had the pleasure of collaborating with Professor [Liyan Song](https://sunnysong14.github.io/)
and [Siang Yew Chong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cI4Rf8cAAAAJ&hl=en).
Additionally, I was a visiting student at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), where I interned under
Professor [Pengtao Xie](https://pengtaoxie.github.io/) and Professor [Yuanyuan Shi](https://yyshi.eng.ucsd.edu/) in
separate projects.

My research interests mainly lie in AutoML and meta-learning, including topics such as hyperparameter optimization,
neural architecture search, data curation, model adaptation, and knowledge transfer.
In addition, I am also interested in AI for dynamic systems and AI for healthcare.
See more details in my [CV](https://t2ance.github.io/files/Curriculum-Vitae.pdf).
**I am actively seeking a PhD position starting in Fall 2025.**
